#PLAYER AND TEAM PLOTTING
#We didn't use these in the final paper, but there's a TON that can be done by
#exploring how xTT Chain breaks down both at a team level
#and exploring how players generate xTT Chain: whether by their own doing
#(i.e. primarily carries and driving play themselves, having a higher normalized personal xTT Chain)
#or by working in a team-oriented context, and having a higher normalized team xTT Chain.
